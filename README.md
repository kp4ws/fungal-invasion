# Fungal Invasion

### About
This project is part of the GameDev.tv 2022 Game Jam:  
https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2022  
  
**Theme: Death is Only the Beginning!**  
  
This is my first time doing a game jam and I've really enjoyed developing this project. Although I didn't have enough time to implement all my ideas, I've learned a lot of new things from the stuff that I did create, such as a procedurally generated tilemap system.
